Hello!  This is a romhack and pet project by surskitty, based heavily on Pokemon Emerald but with a focus on double battles. It does have increased difficulty compared to the main games, but is not meant as a hard mode hack. If you are losing in not-fun ways, that is a bug to report.

This hack includes all the typical battle system upgrades from RHH's [pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/) 1.10.1, including Mega Evolution. In general -- assume things work as in gen 9, except with megas and without Tera.

## Gameplay Changes
- Most Pok&eacute;mon have multiple abilities active at once! If a Pok&eacute;mon seems boring, that is a bug worth reporting.
- As long as you have the HM, the appropriate badge, and a Pok&eacute;mon that can learn the move in your party, you can use _most_ HMs without devoting a moveslot to it. Surf is the big exception.
- Pokemon can be nicknamed from the summary screen and have their moves relearned from the moves tab.
- TMs and move tutors are reusable. Move tutors are massively expanded; TMs are mildly edited. _Most_ move tutors are in the same places there was a tutor in Emerald; the exceptions are the Slateport name rater's house and the Mauville Pok&eacute;mon Center.
- Garbodor, Drednaw, and Orbeetle have mega evolutions.
- Castform has been made interesting.
- Wiglett and Wugtrio are now Water/Ground. Ledian has been given Huge Power. This fulfills the contract that every hack must give _something_ Huge Power. Ledian has also had its base attack raised by a whopping 10 points.
- The Roggenrola line has been reworked to not be a Golem knockoff. Free Gigalith and let it be the special attacker it always dreamed.
- Mienfoo evolves in a normal amount of time.
- Many Pok&eacute;mon can be found on the overworld! They are usually selections of the local wild Pok&eacute;mon, but a few are vagrants.
- The limit on how many Pok&eacute;blocks a Pok&eacute;mon can be fed has been removed. There is now no downside to feeding your Pok&eacute;mon bad Pok&eacute;blocks.

## Evolution Methods
- Trade evolutions all work like Legends Arceus, which is to say: you use the item. Most evolution items can be bought in the Lilycove Department Store.
- Eevee evolves into Espeon with a Sun Stone, Umbreon with a Moon Stone, Sylveon with friendship and a Fairy move, Leafeon with a Leaf Stone, and Glaceon with either an Ice Stone or by bringing it into the Shoal Cave ice room. Leafeon does not have a location evolution and Espeon and Umbreon do not have friendship evolutions for balance reasons.
- Pikachu only evolves into Alolan Raichu.
- Koffing evolves into Galarian Weezing by raising its Beauty. Again, Pok&eacute;blocks are _not_ capped, so don't feel bad if your Pok&eacute;blocks are below par.
- Charcadet evolves into Armarouge with a Dawn Stone and Ceruledge with a Dusk Stone.
- Ursaring evolves into Ursaluna with the Moon Stone. This may be changed to a map location eventually.

## Noncanon Abilities & Traits
Credits to [bassforte123](https://github.com/bassforte123/pokeemerald-complete/tree/Trait-System)'s system for having Pok&eacute;mon have multiple abilities. 

While the Ability slot has multiple possibilities within a species, all Pok&eacute;mon of a species have up to three Innates. 

Entrainment, Skill Swap, Trace, and other Ability-changing effects only work with Abilities, not Innates. For that reason, some Pok&eacute;mon like Plusle have Plus as both a Trait and an Ability. It does not stack; there is no advantage to having an Ability identical to the Innates unless you intend on altering Abilities in some manner.

My intention is for each Pok&eacute;mon species to have at least one thing it's good at, without being unintuitive what's within a Pok&eacute;mon's capabilities. If a Pok&eacute;mon's innates seem particularly underpowered, overpowered, or unintuitive, please inform me.
