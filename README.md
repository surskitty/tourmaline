Hello!  This is a romhack and pet project by surskitty, based heavily on Pokemon Emerald but with a focus on double battles. It does have increased difficulty compared to the main games, but is not meant as a hard mode hack; you should be able to clear with a team of your favorites and only mild strategy.

This hack includes all the typical battle system upgrades from RHH's [pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/) 1.10.1, including Mega Evolution. Dynamax and Z-moves are _not_ present, however.

## Gameplay Changes
- Most Pok&eacute;mon have multiple abilities active at once! If a Pok&eacute;mon seems boring, that is a bug worth reporting.
- As long as you have the HM, the appropriate badge, and a Pok&eacute;mon that can learn the move in your party, you can use _most_ HMs without devoting a moveslot to it. Surf is the big exception.
- Pokemon can be nicknamed from the summary screen and have their moves relearned from the moves tab.
- TMs and move tutors are reusable. Move tutors are massively expanded; TMs are mildly edited. _Most_ move tutors are in the same places there was a tutor in Emerald; the exceptions are the Slateport name rater's house and the Mauville Pok&eacute;mon Center.
- Garbodor, Drednaw, and Orbeetle have mega evolutions.
- Castform has been made interesting.

## Evolution Methods
- Trade evolutions all work like Legends Arceus, which is to say: you use the item. Most evolution items can be bought in the Lilycove Department Store.
- Pikachu and Exeggutor evolve into their Alolan Forms with a Sun Stone.
- Koffing evolves into Galarian Weezing by raising its Beauty.
- Eevee evolves into Espeon with a Sun Stone, Umbreon with a Moon Stone, Sylveon with friendship and a Fairy move, Leafeon with a Leaf Stone, and Glaceon with either an Ice Stone or by bringing it into the Shoal Cave ice room. Leafeon has no location evolution method for balance reasons.
- Charcadet evolves into Armarouge with a Dawn Stone and Ceruledge with a Dusk Stone.
- Ursaring evolves into Ursaluna with the Moon Stone. This may be changed to a map location if I ever bother sorting out somewhere swampy, probably around Mossdeep.

## Noncanon Abilities & Traits
Credits to [bassforte123](https://github.com/bassforte123/pokeemerald-complete/tree/Trait-System)'s system for having Pok&eacute;mon have multiple abilities. 

While the Ability slot has multiple possibilities within a species, all Pok&eacute;mon of a species have up to three Innates. 

Entrainment, Skill Swap, Trace, and other Ability-changing effects only work with Abilities, not Innates. For that reason, some Pok&eacute;mon like Plusle have Plus as both a Trait and an Ability. It does not stack; there is no advantage to having an Ability identical to the Innates unless you intend on altering Abilities in some manner.

My intention is for each Pok&eacute;mon species to have at least one thing it's good at, without being unintuitive what's within a Pok&eacute;mon's capabilities. If a Pok&eacute;mon's innates seem particularly underpowered, overpowered, or unintuitive, please inform me.
