Hello!  This is a romhack and pet project by surskitty, based heavily on Pokemon Emerald but with a focus on double battles. It does have increased difficulty compared to the main games, but is not meant as a hard mode hack; you should be able to clear with a team of your favorites and only mild strategy.

This hack includes all the typical battle system upgrades from RHH's [pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/) 1.10.1, including Mega Evolution. Dynamax and Z-moves are _not_ present, however.

## Noncanon Gameplay Adjustments
- Trade evolutions all work like Legends Arceus, which is to say: you use the item. Most evolution items can be bought in the Lilycove Department Store.
- Pikachu and Exeggutor evolve into their Alolan Forms with a Sun Stone.
- Koffing evolves into Galarian Weezing by raising its Beauty.
- Cubone evolves into Alolan Marowak with a Fire Stone.
- Eevee evolves into Espeon with a Sun Stone, Umbreon with a Moon Stone, Sylveon with friendship and a Fairy move, Leafeon with a Leaf Stone, and Glaceon with either an Ice Stone or by bringing it into the Shoal Cave ice room. Leafeon has no location evolution method for balance reasons.
- Charcadet evolves into Armarouge with a Dawn Stone and Ceruledge with a Dusk Stone.
