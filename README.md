Hello!  This is a romhack and pet project by surskitty, based heavily on Pokemon Emerald but with a focus on double battles. It does have increased difficulty compared to the main games, but is not meant as a hard mode hack. If you are losing in not-fun ways, that is a bug to report.

This hack includes all the typical battle system upgrades from RHH's [pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/) 1.10.1, including Mega Evolution. In general -- assume things work as in gen 9, except with megas and without Tera.

## Notable Pok&eacute;mon Changes
- Most Pok&eacute;mon have multiple abilities active at once! If a Pok&eacute;mon seems boring, that is a bug worth reporting.
- Garbodor, Drednaw, and Orbeetle have mega evolutions.
- Castform has been made interesting.
- Wiglett and Wugtrio are now Water/Ground.
- Ledian has been given Huge Power. This fulfills the contract that every hack must give _something_ Huge Power. Ledian has also had its base attack raised by a whopping 10 points.
- Mienfoo evolves in the mid-30s.
- The Roggenrola line has been reworked to not be a Golem knockoff; Gigalith is now the special attacker it always dreamed of.

## Evolution Methods
- Trade evolutions all work like Legends Arceus, which is to say: you use the item. Most evolution items can be bought in the Lilycove Department Store.
- Eevee evolves into Espeon with a Sun Stone, Umbreon with a Moon Stone, Sylveon with friendship and a Fairy move, Leafeon with a Leaf Stone, and Glaceon with either an Ice Stone or by bringing it into the Shoal Cave ice room. Leafeon does not have a location evolution and Espeon and Umbreon do not have friendship evolutions for balance reasons.
- Pikachu only evolves into Alolan Raichu.
- Koffing evolves into Galarian Weezing by raising its Beauty. Pok&eacute;blocks are less painful now, though.
- Charcadet evolves into Armarouge with a Dawn Stone and Ceruledge with a Dusk Stone.
- Ursaring evolves into Ursaluna with the Moon Stone. This may be changed to a map location eventually.

## QOL Improvements
- Surf is now the only HM.  The rest are Exploration Machines, which can be deleted at will.  The ones useless in battle can also be used without actually being known by the Pok&eacute;mon.
- Pokemon can be nicknamed from the summary screen and have their moves relearned from the moves tab. The Move Relearner now teaches Egg Moves instead.
- TMs and move tutors are reusable. Move tutors are massively expanded; TMs are mildly edited. _Most_ move tutors are in the same places there was a tutor in Emerald, plus also the Slateport name rater's house and the Mauville Pok&eacute;mon Center dude.
- Many Pok&eacute;mon can be found on the overworld! They are usually selections of the local wild Pok&eacute;mon, with some exceptions.
- The limit on how many Pok&eacute;blocks a Pok&eacute;mon can be fed has been removed. There is now no downside to feeding your Pok&eacute;mon bad Pok&eacute;blocks.
- Berries are far more available, and the yields of Berry Trees are at XY standards, so it is actively beneficial to plant berries every time you harvest some.
- Any Pok&eacute;mon in your party holding an Amulet Coin is sufficient for it to take effect.
- ... and many more!

## Noncanon Abilities & Traits
Credits to [bassforte123](https://github.com/bassforte123/pokeemerald-complete/tree/Trait-System)'s system for having Pok&eacute;mon have multiple abilities. 

While the Ability slot has multiple possibilities within a species, all Pok&eacute;mon of a species have up to three Innates. 

Entrainment, Skill Swap, Trace, and other Ability-changing effects only work with Abilities, not Innates. For that reason, some Pok&eacute;mon like Plusle have Plus as both a Trait and an Ability. It does not stack; there is no advantage to having an Ability identical to the Innates unless you intend on altering Abilities in some manner.

My intention is for each Pok&eacute;mon species to have at least one thing it's good at, without being unintuitive what's within a Pok&eacute;mon's capabilities. If a Pok&eacute;mon's innates seem particularly underpowered, overpowered, or unintuitive, please inform me.
